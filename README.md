  Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hamid

I'm a machine learning enthusiast and a M.Sc. graduate in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Calgary. I'm always curious about what's under the hood of machine learning models! 

Nowadays, I'm developing Grad-Learn, an open-source Python library supported by PyTorch and Pyro on the backend. Grad-Learn enables flexible and scalable statistical learning and inference for large data sets, unifying the best of modern deep learning and classic machine learning (read more about [Grad-Learn](https://hh197.github.io/Grad-Learn/)). Check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/HH197/Portfolio) for some of my projects, micro-projects, skills, certificates, and achievements.

In my free time, I like to read, hike, travel, and watch documentaries and TV series.
